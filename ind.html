<h1>History of Nigeria</h1>
<p>The Federation of Nigeria was granted full independence on <strong>1 October 1960 </strong> under a 
    constitution that provided for a parliamentary government and a substantial measure 
    of self-government for the country's three regions. From 1959 to 1960, 
    Jaja Wachuku was the First Nigerian Speaker of the Nigerian Parliament, also 
    called the "House of Representatives." Jaja Wachuku replaced Sir Frederick Metcalfe 
    of Britain. Notably, as First Speaker of the House, Jaja Wachuku received 
    Nigeria's Instrument of Independence, also known as Freedom Charter, 
    on 1 October 1960, from Princess Alexandra of Kent, the Queen's representative 
    at the Nigerian independence ceremonies. Queen Elizabeth II was monarch of Nigeria 
    and head of state, and Nigeria was a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. 
    The Federal government was given exclusive powers in defence, foreign relations, 
    and commercial and fiscal policy. </p>
